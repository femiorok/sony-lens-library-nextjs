Landscape photography is photography centered around capturing the natural beauty of the world. It caters to a diverse range of styles, from calm and natural to stylized and dramatic. Popular among travelers and people interested in nature.

Considerations for this type of photography are:
- a wide-angle lens that can capture landmarks and vista
- a zoom range to allow for diversity in compositions
- good low-light performance 
- some photographers enjoy shooting landscapes with telephoto lenses, but this isn't as common

Travel photography is perfect for small, mirrorless kits. With the right camera and lens combo, you can capture memories that you can keep in high quality for a lifetime. Travel photographers may value the size of small prime lenses, or the versatility of zoom lenses depending on taste. Low light performance is also of relevance. 


Sports

Sports photogaphy is centered around high-paced action and capturing critical moments. Of chief importance is getting a lens that will focus quickly and reliably. Additionally,
good low light performance is mandatory, as shooting with fast shutter speeds will bring down your exposure, forcing you to lean more heavily on your ISO and aperture. For indoor sports such as basketball or 
volleyball, a short-telehpoto lens like an 85mm may work if the photographer can get close to the action (like on a sideline) and is only shooting one side of the field. Outside of that, most shooters will
prefer a lens that allows them to zoom to 200mm+.

Content Creation

Content creation has taken the world by storm as social media becomes more and more popular. Whether for a business, an artist, or a vlogger, Sony has lenses that make it easy for such photographers/videographers
to get amazing imagery. For this genre, most subject matter will usually be of people (or the creator themselves) or b-roll (footage/pictures of secondary subjects, like products, environments etc. that are related to
the primary subject). Based on this, wide angle portrait lenses are popular.

Macro & Product

One genre where the quality of a Sony camera can shine is macro/product photography. With the right lens, you'll be able to get extremely close to your subject, which is great for people who are selling small
items like jewelre. Macro lenses have excellent sharpness to account for this as well. Additionally, the longer the focal length on a macro lens, the better. If you're shooting with a wider-angle macro lens, you'll
have to get even closer to your object to get your desired shot, which can block light from hitting it and make the shot that much harder to get. 

Many people buy extension tubes instead of macro lenses, but a dedicated lens will always be better thanks to allowing you to maintain fully functional autofocus, whereas many extension tubes take away your ability 
to focus at different distances (or take away your ability to focus altogether), along with potentially losing ability to control your aperture through your camera and other downsides. They are good for adding some fun
to your existing lenses, but not for consistent macro/product work.

Real Estate/Architecture

Real Estate photography is an important venture for many agents who want to take their own pictures, or photographers who do it for a living. Wide angle is the name of the game here, as just a few mm can make the difference
between getting the entirety of the room and losing some. For example, the Sony full-frame kit lens starts at 28mm. To go from 28mm to a real wide angle of 16mm, you get a huge angle of view increase from seeing approx. 
75 degrees to approx. 110-105 degrees, which is an increase of 40%.

Portraits

Portraits are the bread and butter of many photographers world-wide. Thanks to Sony features like Eye-AF, taking great pictures of people is easier than ever; the hard part is choosing from the abundance of amazing lenses
available. Portrait photographers utilize "bokeh", or background blur as one of their primary tools for isolating their subject and creating an aesthetically pleasing image. Depending on style and circumstance, the photographer may 
want to go more wide (such as with a 35mm) to take an environmental portrait, or they may want to go telephoto (such as with an 85mm, sometimes even a 200mm) for headshots or full-body images with beautiful bokeh. Either way,
Sony has you covered.
