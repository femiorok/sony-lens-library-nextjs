## Landscape

Landscape photography is photography centered around capturing the natural beauty of the world. It caters to a diverse range of styles, from calm and natural to stylized and dramatic. Popular among travelers and people interested in nature.

Considerations for this type of photography are:
- A wide-angle lens that can capture landmarks and vista
- A zoom range to allow for diversity in compositions
- Good low-light performance 
- Some photographers enjoy shooting landscapes with telephoto lenses, but this isn't as common
