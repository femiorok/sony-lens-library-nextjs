## Travel

Travel photography is perfect for small, mirrorless kits. With the right camera and lens combo, you can capture memories that you can keep in high quality for a lifetime. Travel photographers may value the size of small prime lenses, or the versatility of zoom lenses depending on taste. Low light performance is also of relevance.
