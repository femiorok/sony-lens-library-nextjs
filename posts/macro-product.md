## Macro & Product

One genre where the quality of a Sony camera can shine is macro/product photography. With the right lens, you'll be able to get extremely close to your subject, which is great for people who are selling small
items like jewelre. Macro lenses have excellent sharpness to account for this as well. Additionally, the longer the focal length on a macro lens, the better. If you're shooting with a wider-angle macro lens, you'll
have to get even closer to your object to get your desired shot, which can block light from hitting it and make the shot that much harder to get. 

Many people buy extension tubes instead of macro lenses, but a dedicated lens will always be better thanks to allowing you to maintain fully functional autofocus, whereas many extension tubes take away your ability 
to focus at different distances (or take away your ability to focus altogether), along with potentially losing ability to control your aperture through your camera and other downsides. They are good for adding some fun
to your existing lenses, but not for consistent macro/product work.
