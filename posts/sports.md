## Sports

Sports photogaphy is centered around high-paced action and capturing critical moments. Of chief importance is getting a lens that will focus quickly and reliably. Additionally,
good low light performance is mandatory, as shooting with fast shutter speeds will bring down your exposure, forcing you to lean more heavily on your ISO and aperture. For indoor sports such as basketball or 
volleyball, a short-telehpoto lens like an 85mm may work if the photographer can get close to the action (like on a sideline) and is only shooting one side of the field. Outside of that, most shooters will
prefer a lens that allows them to zoom to 200mm+.
