## Real Estate & Architecture 

Real Estate photography is an important venture for many agents who want to take their own pictures, or photographers who do it for a living. Wide angle is the name of the game here, as just a few mm can make the difference

between getting the entirety of the room and losing some. For example, the Sony full-frame kit lens starts at 28mm. To go from 28mm to a real wide angle of 16mm, you get a huge angle of view increase from seeing approx. 
75 degrees to approx. 110-105 degrees, which is an increase of 40%.
