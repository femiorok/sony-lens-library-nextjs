## Portraits


Portraits are the bread and butter of many photographers world-wide. Thanks to Sony features like Eye-AF, taking great pictures of people is easier than ever; the hard part is choosing from the abundance of amazing lenses
available. Portrait photographers utilize "bokeh", or background blur as one of their primary tools for isolating their subject and creating an aesthetically pleasing image. Depending on style and circumstance, the photographer may 
want to go more wide (such as with a 35mm) to take an environmental portrait, or they may want to go telephoto (such as with an 85mm, sometimes even a 200mm) for headshots or full-body images with beautiful bokeh. Either way,
Sony have you covered.
