## Content Creation

Content creation has taken the world by storm as social media becomes more and more popular. Whether for a business, an artist, or a vlogger, Sony has lenses that make it easy for such photographers/videographers
to get amazing imagery. For this genre, most subject matter will usually be of people (or the creator themselves) or b-roll (footage/pictures of secondary subjects, like products, environments etc. that are related to
the primary subject). Based on this, wide angle portrait lenses are popular.
